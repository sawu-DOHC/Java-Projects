This example demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism in Java with the Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle classes.

Inheritance allows one class to use features from another class. In this example, Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle inherit from GeometricShape, so they can use its methods.

Polymorphism allows different classes to be used in similar ways. Each class (Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle) provides its own version of methods for calculating area and perimeter.
