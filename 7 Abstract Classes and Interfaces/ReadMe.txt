This Java program demonstrates the use of abstract classes and interfaces in object-oriented programming. It includes a hierarchy of classes that model various creatures and their behaviors, highlighting the application of both abstract classes and interfaces. Below is the class hierarchy. 

Interfaces (Eat, Sound, Swim, Attack, Fly)

Superclass------------------Abstract Class------------------Concrete Class

~~~ABSTRACT SUPER CLASS~~~~

Creature: An abstract class that represents a general creature. It implements the Eat interface and defines common attributes such as name, age, and species, along with getters, setters, and an abstract method eat().




~~~ABSTRACT CLASSES~~~~

Human: An abstract class that extends Creature and implements the Sound interface. It adds an attribute job and provides additional functionality specific to humans.

Animal: An abstract class extending Creature but without additional interfaces. It introduces attributes like habitat and diet, along with methods specific to animals.

Insect: An abstract class extending Creature and does not implement any interfaces. It introduces attributes like numberOfLegs and hasWings.




~~~CONCRETE CLASSES~~~

Programmer
Soldier

Turtle
Pigeon

Ladybug
Spider




~~~INTERFACE CLASSES~~~

Eat: An interface defining a method eat(), implemented by various classes to specify what they eat.

Sound: An interface defining a method sound(), implemented by classes that can make sounds.

Swim: An interface defining a method swim(), implemented by classes that can swim.

Attack: An interface defining a method attack(), implemented by classes capable of attacking.

Fly: An interface defining a method fly(), implemented by classes that can fly.
