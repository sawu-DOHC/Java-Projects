This example demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism in Java with the Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle classes.

Inheritance allows one class to use features from another class. In this example, Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle inherit from the GeometricShape super class so they can use its methods.

Polymorphism allows different classes to be used in similar ways. In this project each class (Triangle, Rectangle, and Circle) provides its own version of methods for calculating area and perimeter.
